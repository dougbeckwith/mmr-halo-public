# Halo MMR

- This app was built to help anyone visualize their match making rating and competitive skill rating data in Halo Infinite. 
- It helps solve the problem of understanding your ratings as the ranking system does not give players good feedback. 
- When the website was live it got around 1000 unique users per day and over 10,000 page loads a day.
- Although the game has become inactive and we no longer play it, we have taken it down. 
- It provided users with the capability to compare their hidden rank with their current rank.
- You can gauge the difficulty of the match by comparing the MMR (Matchmaking Rating) of your team to that of the enemy team.
- Users could also access information on the projected number of kills and deaths, including the standard deviation, that the match anticipated them to achieve.
